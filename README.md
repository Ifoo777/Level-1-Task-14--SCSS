# Level 1 Task 14 -SCSS

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Find a published webpage that you particularly like (not something you’ve
already made). It could be from Netflix, takealot, ucook, or any other website
you like.

● Create an HTML file called copy-cat.html.

● Using HTML and SCSS, try to recreate the webpage as best you can.

● Add the URL of the webpage you are recreating as a link at the bottom of
your webpage.

● You may want to do some research on more CSS and SCSS elements for
greater functionality.
